# Go Developer Training

This repository stores the challenges I completed during the **Go Developer Training at DIO**.

## üéØ About the Training

Training taught by professor **Tenille Martins** on the DIO platform, focused on developing practical Go skills through progressive challenges.

## üöÄ Challenges

### Challenge 1: Thermometric Converter from Kelvin to Celsius | [repo](https://github.com/andrecodea/formacao-go-developer/blob/main/desafios/desafio%202/conversor.go)

- **Objective:** Temperature scale conversion with Go
- **Challenge:** Develop a program to convert water's boiling point from Kelvin to Celsius
- **Solution:** I created a program that converts any temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and automatically identifies water's boiling and freezing points with specific messages

### Challenge 2: Numbers Divisible by 3 Detector | [repo](https://github.com/andrecodea/formacao-go-developer/blob/main/desafios/desafio%201/divtres.go)

- **Objective:** Detect numbers divisible by 3 in Go
- **Challenge:** Implement detection using `for` loop and modulo operator (`%`)
- **Solution:** I developed a function that identifies numbers divisible by 3 within a determined range using repetition structures and mathematical operations

### Challenge 3: PinPan | [repo](https://github.com/andrecodea/formacao-go-developer/blob/main/desafios/desafio%203/pinpan.go)

- **Objective:** Implement a custom "FizzBuzz" style program
- **Challenge:** Display "Pin" for numbers divisible by 3 and "Pan" for those divisible by 5
- **Solution:** I created a function that combines the verifications from previous challenges, detecting divisibility by 3 and 5 simultaneously using `for` loop and modulo operator (`%`)
