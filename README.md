## üéØ About the Training

Training taught by professor **Tenille Martins** on the DIO platform, focused on developing practical Go skills through progressive challenges.

## üöÄ Challenges

### Challenge 1: Thermometric Converter from Kelvin to Celsius | [repo](challenge1-temperature-converter.go)

- **Objective:** Temperature scale conversion with Go
- **Challenge:** Develop a program to convert water's boiling point from Kelvin to Celsius
- **Solution:** I created a program that converts any temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and automatically identifies water's boiling and freezing points with specific messages

### Challenge 2: Numbers Divisible by 3 Detector | [repo](challenge2-divisible-by-three.go)

- **Objective:** Detect numbers divisible by 3 in Go
- **Challenge:** Implement detection using `for` loop and modulo operator (`%`)
- **Solution:** I developed a function that identifies numbers divisible by 3 within a determined range using repetition structures and mathematical operations

### Challenge 3: PinPan | [repo](challenge3-pinpan.go)

- **Objective:** Implement a custom "FizzBuzz" style program
- **Challenge:** Display "Pin" for numbers divisible by 3 and "Pan" for those divisible by 5
- **Solution:** I created a function that combines the verifications from previous challenges, detecting divisibility by 3 and 5 simultaneously using `for` loop and modulo operator (`%`)

### Challenge 4: Ping Pong | [repo](challenge4-pingpong-concurrency.go)

- **Objective:** Implement a pingpong program using concurrency
- **Challenge:** Implement concurrency to print "ping" and "pong" one after the other, using goroutines, and channels.
- **Solution:** I created two channels that send "ping" and "pong", had a receiving end in a loop that prints the message and sleeps for 1 second. Aditionally, I used sync to syncronize both goroutines and prevent the main goroutine from ending the program without any returns, using WaitGroup functions `Add()` , `Wait()` and `Done()`.
